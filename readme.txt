== Description ==

Holiday Logo Switcher provides you a way to display a different logo depending on the holiday (or just the range of dates you want).

Follow the evolution of the plugin trough the [Github repository](https://github.com/multimedianj/holiday-logo-switcher).

## How it works

1. In **Settings > Holiday Logo Switcher**, you have the possibility to set a **Default logo** to display if you don't have any holiday at the moment.
1. You can also set a dark logo in the **Dark mode logo** field, wich will be activated only if dark mode is enabled in your browser (this is compatible with the plugin [A11y Kit](https://wordpress.org/plugins/a11y-kit) wich has a dark mode setting that can be enabled and comes with pre-configured styles).
1. In the **Holiday Logos** menu, you can just add a logo by clicking **Add New**. After that, just configure your date range (from DD/MM/YYYY to DD/MM/YY) and click on **Save**.
1. To display your logo anywhere you want, just add the shortcode **[hls]** and that's it.

This plugin was created and is maintained by WP inclusion, a [glossary of Web accessibility terminologies](https://wpinclusion.com).
